C  Try moving to the next extension in the FITS file, if it exists.
C  The FTMRHD subroutine attempts to move to the next HDU, as specified by
C  the second parameter.   This subroutine moves by a relative number of
C  HDUs from the current HDU.  The related FTMAHD routine may be used to
C  move to an absolute HDU number in the FITS file.  If the end-of-file is
C  encountered when trying to move to the specified extension, then a
C  status = 107 is returned.
      call ftmrhd(unit,1,hdutype,status)

C  The FITS file must always be closed before exiting the program. 
C  Any unit numbers allocated with FTGIOU must be freed with FTFIOU.
